# filesort
This is a python script that sorts files into subdirectories either by their name or fileformat. Releases compiles the filesort.pyw file using pyinstaller. 

# disclaimer
Please be aware that this is not perfect so make sure to test it before using it on any important files.
If you use this to sort large number of files, it may not be instantaneous, so give it some time and only close the program after a popup appears informing you of the completion.

I created it since I got lots of ebooks in different format, some being the same book. This might be helpful with archiving files.
